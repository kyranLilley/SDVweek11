Introduction to Data Structure stores. 

In javascript you can have multiple types of Data Structure stores , some of the main ones include - 

Arrays. 
An array is used to store values/data and is typically set as a vaiable so it can be later called in code. Each element of this array has stored data that can be called in the arrays entirety or seperate

Queues.
Queues are sequential structures , Queues are similar to stacks however queues are FIFI as opposed to LIFO. They are a way to keep requests in order until a time the request can be recieved. 
Linked Lists.
Linked Lists are a more unique data structure , These elements that get stored are not as physical as arrays and ques they are stored in "nodes that contain a pointer to the next node."Linked lists will be spoken about more in section 2 of this task. 
Trees.

Graphs.

Hash Tables(map).
